Problem_4.m takes a directory as an input, and returns the size (in bytes) of that directory. 

The parameter must be a valid directory, meaning it has quotes on either side, such as the following:

''' 'C:\Users\Henry' '''

so, it should be called in the following way

''' Problem_4('C:\Users\Henry') '''



'''getTriangleArea.m''' takes a cell array of coordinates as a parameter. It must be length 3 with each element containing 2 values.

The points should be organized as follows: '''{{x1,y1},{x2,y2},{x3,y3}}'''


'''genFunc.m''' outputs a function handle based on the parameters entered. However, it will first ask the user to input an x value and automatically call the nested function which will return the specific solution to the function with that given value.
